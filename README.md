# petcupid_net_core
PetCupid using .Net Core and Typescript

# Goals

* I want to learn more about the new open-source stack from Microsoft, and check if I can develop without Windows in practice.
* I want to compare working with ReactJS instead of AngularJS
* I want a typesafe UI by using TypeScript

# Documentation/Links

[.Net Core](https://dotnet.github.io/)
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

# Random notes while installing/setting up project

* After install, make sure `/usr/local/share/dotnet/bin` is in your PATH
* Need latest openssl installed (`brew update` && `brew install openssl`)
* Ensure homebrew has been installed in the default location!

* The latest dotnet core RC version apparently does not work with the latest asp.net RC. Documentation not really up to date.

* Other install instructions: [ASP.NET](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/getting-started/installing-on-mac.html). Still uses dnx/dnvm commands instead of dotnet cli.
